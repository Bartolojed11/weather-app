UI/UX
Color Scheme and inspiration

Color scheme used: Cherry Blossom
Inspiration : Japan is particularly famous for its cherry blossom due its large number of varieties and the nationwide celebrations during the blooming season

Why this UI/UX the best?
Before designing this ui/ux, first I checked all the input fields and data that can be returned from the given api,
and I've based the design from it to match with it.

This interface is also responsive and the placing of the search input field is placed on almost the center of the screen
where a user's eye always point to when visiting a page.

The search field is also a bit larger so that it can easily direct the eyes viewer to main function of the system.

Some locations are also displayed on the home page in order to minimize the action a user will do before he/she can 
view the locations information
